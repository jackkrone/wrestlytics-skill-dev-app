1. I moved all the react app files (except node_modules dir) into a subdirectory called client
2. ran `npm install`
3. followed directions from './eslint_errors_issue.txt' on new node_modules dir
4. `npm start` successfully started the app

Not confident this will not lead to issues in the future. I created the react app a while back by cd'ing
into wrestlytics directory and running `npx create react app .`.
